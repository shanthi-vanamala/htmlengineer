1.what are variables and why are they called variables?Assign two numbers to variables'a' and 'b',and print their sum.
A.In programming and mathematics,a variable is a named storage location that holds a value,and that value can change during the execution of a program or during the solving of an equation.They are called "variables"
a=4
b=2
print(a+b)
output:6
2.write a python program to subtract two numbers and print the result.
A.a=2
  b=1
  print(a-b)
  output:1
3.multiply two variables and store the result in a third variable.print all three. num1=2  num2=3
  num3=num1*num2
  print(num1)
  print(num2)
  print(num3)
  output:2
         3
         6
4.Divide 10 by 3 and print the result with and without decimals.
A.a=6
  b=3
  print(a//b)
  output:2
5.use floor division'//'to divide 17 by 4.print the output.
A.num1=17
  num2=4
  print(num1//num2)
  output:4
6.use the modulator operator'%'to chack the remainder when 25 is divided by 6.
A.a=25
  b=6
  print(a%b)
  output:1
7.calculate and print the square of a number stored in a variable.
A.num=4
  print(num**4)
  output:8
8.Assign values to three variables 'x','y','z' and compute the average.
A.x=2
  y=3
  z=4
  average=x+y+z/3
  print(average)
  output:3
9.Take a number and find its cube using the'**'operator.
A.num=2
  print(2**3)
  output:6
10.create two variables'length'and'width'.calculate and print area of a rectangle.
A.length=5
  width=3
  print(length*width)
  output:15
11.Assign a variable 'total_marks=450'and 'obtained_marks=375'.find percentage.
A.total_marks=450
  obtained_marks=375
  percentage=(total_marks/obtained_marks)*100
  print(percentage)
  output:120.0
12.write a python statement that calculate'(a+b)*'for some values of a,b,c.
A.a=5
  b=6
  c=8
  print((a+b)*c)
  output:88
